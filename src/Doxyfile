# Doxyfile 1.3.3

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project
#
# All text after a hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored
# The format is:
#       TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists items can also be appended using:
#       TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (" ")

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# General configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded 
# by quotes) that should identify the project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "The Evolving Tree"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. 
# This could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or 
# if some version control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         = 1

GENERATE_HTML          = YES
GENERATE_LATEX         = NO
GENERATE_MAN           = NO
GENERATE_RTF           = NO

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) 
# base path where the generated documentation will be put. 
# If a relative path is entered, it will be relative to the location 
# where doxygen was started. If left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = ../docs/doxy
EXTRACT_ALL            = NO

# If the EXTRACT_PRIVATE tag is set to YES all private members of a class 
# will be included in the documentation.

EXTRACT_PRIVATE        = YES
HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS     = NO

HIDE_UNDOC_CLASSES     = NO

# If the BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will 
# include brief member descriptions after the members that are listed in 
# the file and class documentation (similar to JavaDoc). 
# Set to NO to disable this.

BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC      = YES

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES then Doxygen will prepend the full 
# path before files name in the file list and in the header files. If set 
# to NO the shortest path that makes the file name unique will be used.

FULL_PATH_NAMES        = NO

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES then the STRIP_FROM_PATH tag 
# can be used to strip a user-defined part of the path. Stripping is 
# only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand part of 
# the path. It is allowed to use relative paths in the argument list.

STRIP_FROM_PATH        = 

# If the HIDE_SCOPE_NAMES tag is set to NO (the default) then Doxygen 
# will show members with their full class and namespace scopes in the 
# documentation. If set to YES the scope will be hidden.

HIDE_SCOPE_NAMES       = NO

# If the SHOW_INCLUDE_FILES tag is set to YES (the default) then Doxygen 
# will put a list of the files that are included by a file in the documentation 
# of that file.

SHOW_INCLUDE_FILES     = YES

# If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then Doxygen 
# will interpret the first line (until the first dot) of a JavaDoc-style 
# comment as the brief description. If set to NO, the JavaDoc 
# comments will behave just like the Qt-style comments (thus requiring an 
# explict @brief command for a brief description.

JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF      = NO

# The MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF tag can be set to YES to make Doxygen 
# treat a multi-line C++ special comment block (i.e. a block of //! or /// 
# comments) as a brief description. This used to be the default behaviour. 
# The new default is to treat a multi-line C++ comment block as a detailed 
# description. Set this tag to YES if you prefer the old behaviour instead.

MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF = NO

# If the INHERIT_DOCS tag is set to YES (the default) then an undocumented 
# member inherits the documentation from any documented member that it 
# reimplements.

INHERIT_DOCS           = YES

# The TAB_SIZE tag can be used to set the number of spaces in a tab. 
# Doxygen uses this value to replace tabs by spaces in code fragments.

TAB_SIZE               = 8
GENERATE_TODOLIST      = NO
GENERATE_TESTLIST      = NO
GENERATE_BUGLIST       = NO
GENERATE_DEPRECATEDLIST= NO

# The INPUT tag can be used to specify the files and/or directories that contain 
# documented source files. You may enter file names like "myfile.cpp" or 
# directories like "/usr/src/myproject". Separate the files or directories 
# with spaces.

INPUT                  = 

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the 
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard pattern (like *.cpp 
# and *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories. If left 
# blank the following patterns are tested: 
# *.c *.cc *.cxx *.cpp *.c++ *.java *.ii *.ixx *.ipp *.i++ *.inl *.h *.hh *.hxx *.hpp 
# *.h++ *.idl *.odl *.cs

FILE_PATTERNS          = 

RECURSIVE              = NO

# The EXCLUDE tag can be used to specify files and/or directories that should 
# excluded from the INPUT source files. This way you can easily exclude a 
# subdirectory from a directory tree whose root is specified with the INPUT tag.

EXCLUDE                =
